\section{Task}
Our task is voice conversion/ voice style transfer. We hope to find a latent space where movement encodes audible change in style of audio. In our baseline, we trained a cycleGAN to go between male and female audio data. The results were interesting considering the models trained on raw images. We are currently working on building a cyclic model with a wavenet encoder and/or decoder.

\section{Data}
We are using the \href{http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html}{VCTK dataset}. The dataset contains speech from 109 speakers who say approximately 400 sentences from newspapers with wide phonetic and contextual coverage. Audio files are .wav with 48,000 starting sample rate and about a couple of seconds on average in length (about 15 gb of audio). The data is prime for identifying speaker accents and latent space for speaker qualities.

\section{Baseline}
We trained a CycleGAN in Tensorflow on the VCTK dataset. The two collections were male and female audio.
\subsection{Preprocessing and Postprocessing}
A short-time fourier transform was applied on the wav files using librosa and padded to form a 3 channel image of size 256 x 256. The Griffin-Lim algorithm was used for reconstruction of audio from the spectrogram.

\subsection{Training}
The following are results on Google Cloud's K80 GPU instance (12 GB VRAM) after training for a few hours. See Figure \ref{fig:cycleloss}.

\end{figure}

The generative loss oscillates (which seems to be the norm for CycleGAN training), whereas the cycle loss steadily decreases.

\subsection{Results and Thoughts}
Generally, we were surprised by the results we got. We weren't expecting much as we were treating the audio spectrogram as images and running a CycleGAN on images of male and female speech from two large collections. However, results after few tens of thousands of iterations comes out grainy but there is a perceivable pitch change from a male and female voice and vice versa.

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
